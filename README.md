<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>
This project was a slight divergence from the machine learning track most of my other projects follow, and is a smaller project I had on the side as I had wondered about getting into networking. However, as you may be able to tell from my other repositories, I discovered I wasn't very interested.
</p>

<h2>Usage:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Run the main method in the <code>Server</code> class.</li>
  <li>Run the main method in the <code>Client</code> class.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  To add more clients, you must edit the run configurations. In IntelliJ, this is done using the following steps:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click <strong>"Edit Configurations…"</strong> in the top-right run configuration dropdown.</li>
  <li>In the Run/Debug Configurations window:
    <ul>
      <li>Select your <code>Client</code> configuration on the left.</li>
      <li>In the right pane, in the <strong>Build and Run</strong> section, click <strong>Modify options</strong> and ensure <strong>"Allow Multiple Instances"</strong> is checked.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Click <strong>Apply</strong> and then <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
  <li>Now you can run the <code>Client</code> class multiple times to add new clients to the server — each with their own console window.</li>
</ol>
